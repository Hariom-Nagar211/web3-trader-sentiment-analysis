# Web3 Trading Analysis: Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using:
1. **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index** - Market sentiment data
2. **Hyperliquid Historical Trading Data** - Individual trader transactions

## 🎯 Objective

Explore how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment (fear vs greed) to identify hidden trends that could influence smarter trading strategies.

## 📊 Key Analysis Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Date alignment between datasets
- Numeric data cleaning and validation
- Missing value handling

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Fear & Greed Index distribution and trends
- Trading volume and activity patterns
- Temporal analysis of market behavior

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Statistical relationships between sentiment and trading metrics
- Heatmap visualization of correlations
- Identification of strongest predictive factors

### 4. Sentiment-Based Trading Patterns
- Trading behavior during different market sentiments
- Volume, frequency, and profitability analysis
- Risk assessment by sentiment periods

## 🔍 Key Insights

The analysis reveals several important patterns:

1. **Volume Correlation**: Trading volume shows significant correlation with market sentiment
2. **Profitability Patterns**: Different sentiment periods exhibit distinct profitability characteristics
3. **Trader Behavior**: Risk-taking behavior varies significantly across fear/greed cycles
4. **Market Timing**: Optimal entry/exit points can be identified using sentiment indicators

## 📈 Visualizations Generated

1. **EDA Overview**: Distribution plots and time series analysis
2. **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap showing relationships between variables
3. **Sentiment Patterns**: Box plots comparing trading metrics across sentiment categories

## 🎯 Business Applications

- **Risk Management**: Adjust position sizes based on market sentiment
- **Entry/Exit Timing**: Use sentiment indicators for better trade timing
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Balance aggressive/conservative strategies by sentiment
- **Market Making**: Adjust spreads and liquidity provision based on sentiment
